A solid model is fabricated by exposing liquid photo‐hardening polymer to ultraviolet rays, and stacking the cross‐sectional solidified layers. Three types of equipment were constructed, their operational conditions were investigated, and some solid models were fabricated. A transparent plastic model whose internal structure was visible from the outside of the model was obtained. The operations are simple and can be easily automated.

abstract = {Additive manufacturing processes take the information from a computer-aided design (CAD) file that is later converted to a stereolithography (STL) file. In this process, the drawing made in the CAD software is approximated by triangles and sliced containing the information of each layer that is going to be printed. There is a discussion of the relevant additive manufacturing processes and their applications. The aerospace industry employs them because of the possibility of manufacturing lighter structures to reduce weight. Additive manufacturing is transforming the practice of medicine and making work easier for architects. In 2004, the Society of Manufacturing Engineers did a classification of the various technologies and there are at least four additional significant technologies in 2012. Studies are reviewed which were about the strength of products made in additive manufacturing processes. However, there is still a lot of work and research to be accomplished before additive manufacturing technologies become standard in the manufacturing industry because not every commonly used manufacturing material can be handled. The accuracy needs improvement to eliminate the necessity of a finishing process. The continuous and increasing growth experienced since the early days and the successful results up to the present time allow for optimism that additive manufacturing has a significant place in the future of manufacturing.}

abstract = {Abstract Functionally gradient materials (FGM) have gradual variations in their properties along one or more dimensions due to local compositional or structural distinctions by design. Traditionally, hard materials (e.g., metals, ceramics) are used to design and fabricate FGMs; however, there is increasing interest in polymer-based soft and compliant FGMs mainly because of their potential application in the human environment. Soft FGMs are ideally suitable to manage interfacial problems in dissimilar materials used in many emerging devices and systems for human interaction, such as soft robotics and electronic textiles and beyond. Soft systems are ubiquitous in everyday lives; they are resilient and can easily deform, absorb energy, and adapt to changing environments. Here, the basic design and functional principles of biological FGMs and their manmade counterparts are discussed using representative examples. The remarkable multifunctional properties of natural FGMs resulting from their sophisticated hierarchical structures, built from a relatively limited choice of materials, offer a rich source of new design paradigms and manufacturing strategies for manmade materials and systems for emerging technological needs. Finally, the challenges and potential pathways are highlighted to leverage soft materials' facile processability and unique properties toward functional FGMs.},

abstract = {Polymer gradient materials (PGMs) are known to reduce stress concentrations and to increase fracture toughness. The first system we reported for the preparation of longitudinal PGMs was based on poly(dimethyl siloxanes), covering a relatively low Young's modulus range. In this study, we used two photochemically and one thermally curing polyaddition systems, enabling us to cover a much larger modulus range up to 1300 MPa. Three different gradient structures, hard-soft, hard-soft-hard, and soft-hard-soft, were realized and confirmed by position-dependent UV/Vis absorbance measurements. Tensile testing in dependency on the gradient structure was performed. A comparison with non-gradient samples with discrete composition revealed a significant improvement, specifically in the case of hard-soft-hard gradients. Hence, PGMs are a promising approach for the development of materials with a special mechanical property profile particularly at different temperatures, leading to novel thermoresponsive materials.}

PINNs reconstruct the full spatial distribution of the system’s response from the measured portion of the response field and estimate the spatial distribution of unknown material properties. The primary computational expense in this approach is the one-time generation of potential responses for the PINNs, resulting in significant computational efficiency. Furthermore, this study utilizes PINNs to train a model based on the underlying physics described by differential equations, and to quantify aleatoric uncertainty arising from noisy data. We demonstrate several one-dimensional and two-dimensional examples where the elastic modulus distribution is characterized based on static partial-field displacement response measurements. The inversion procedure efficiently provides accurate estimates of material property distributions, showcasing the potential of PINNs in practical applications.}

  abstract  = {The identification of nonhomogeneous elastic property distributions has been traditionally achieved with well acknowledged optimization based inverse approaches, but when full-field displacement measurements are available, the virtual fields method (VFM) can be computationally more efficient by converting the large-scale optimization problem into multiple small-scale optimization problems. A possible downside of the VFM so far was not to take into account prior knowledge, which is often available and needed when there is a very large number of unknowns and the inverse problem is ill-posed. In this work, different approaches are proposed for introducing regularization into the VFM, aiming to penalize the local variations of identified stiffness properties in order to reduce the effects of uncertainty in the inverse problem resolution. The feasibility and accuracy of the regularized VFM are tested through several numerical and experimental datasets. It is shown that the main advantage of the novel VFM approaches is the low computational cost, as large-scale inverse problems with 10,000 unknown parameters can be solved within several seconds using a standard personal computer. Although the regularized VFM can successfully detect a stiff inclusion in a soft solid with high accuracy, regularization also introduces unexpected spurious effects in the results, blurring the interface between soft and stiff regions. We also observed that the regularization did not improve the smoothness significantly due to local effects of the small-scale optimization problem introduced in the proposed VFM method. Therefore, traditional regularization, which penalizes local variations of identified stiffness properties, can be combined with the VFM to solve inverse problems with a high computational efficiency, but supplemental regularization conditions will need to be adapted in the future to better delineate soft-stiff interfaces with this methodology.}

To demonstrate the g-DLP, we show the direct fabrication of complex 2D/3D lattices with controlled buckling and deformation sequence, negative Poisson’s ratio metamaterial, presurgical models with stiffness variations, composites for 4D printing, and anti-counterfeiting 3D printing.}}

  abstract = {Reactive inkjet printing as additive manufacturing technique is evaluated for generation of gradient material made from polyurethane. Therefore dots are fabricated in situ by drop-into-drop inkjet printing of three separate components (2 polyols, 1 isocyanate) successively from three separate print heads. Changing the mixing ratio of the three components enables tailoring of the mechanical properties for each voxel, which raises the potential for printing of gradient materials. This study does not examine the complete additive manufacturing process to build whole 3D objects but its focus is set on the behavior of the printing heads and the printability of the components as well as on properties of the produced material. Regarding the gradient properties it is necessary to ensure that the stoichiometric ratio is given for all mixtures and that the printable masses of each component comply with the desired resolution, i.e. the smallest size of one voxel. This requires determination of the printing parameters and a definition of the achievable range of mechanical properties (e.g. hardness, elastic modulus) which is done in this study by evaluation of casted specimen from polyurethane. Additionally in this study inkjet printability of the polyols and the polyisocyanate in dependence of different fractions of toluene as a solvent is evaluated by determination of the Ohnesorge number Oh. Easily measurable physical properties as density, surface tension and viscosity are determined for several fractions of toluene to calculate 1/Oh. Finally reactive inkjet printing technology with the optimized liquids is used to create dots to form polyurethane.}

    abstract = { A methodology for three-dimensionally printing ultrasoft silicone with a functional stiffness gradient is presented. Ultraviolet-cure silicone was deposited via two independently controlled extruders into a thixotropic, gel-like, silicone oil-based support matrix. Each extruder contained a different liquid silicone formulation. The extrusion rates were independently varied during printing such that the combined selectively deposited material contained different ratios of the two silicones, resulting in localized control of material stiffness. Tests to validate the process are reported, including tensile testing of homogeneous cubic specimens to quantify the range of material stiffness that could be printed, indentation testing of cuboid specimens to characterize printed stiffness gradients, and vibratory testing of synthetic multilayer vocal fold (VF) models to demonstrate that the method may be applied to the fabrication of biomechanical models for voice production research. The cubic specimens exhibited linear stress–strain data with tensile elasticity modulus values between 1.11 and 27.1 kPa, more than a factor of 20 in stiffness variation. The cuboid specimens exhibited material variations that were visually recognizable and quantifiable via indentation testing. The VF models withstood rigorous phonatory flow-induced vibration and exhibited vibratory characteristics comparable to those of previous models. Overall, while process refinements are needed, the results of these tests demonstrate the ability to print ultrasoft silicone with stiffness gradients. }

These technologies utilize a light source to cure the surface of a vat filled with liquid photopolymer resin layer by layer and recent developments in resin composition have led to developments in 4D printing. 4D printing is an extension of 3D printing in which the object transforms itself into a predefined structure upon the application of external stimuli such as heat, humidity, or light amongst others. This review paper presents a comprehensive review on the materials used to manufacture stimuli-responsive/shape morphing structures via vat photopolymerization technologies (stereolithography (SLA), micro-SLA (PµSL), digital light processing (DLP), and volumetric printing). Overall, the literature review has shown that acrylate-based resins are the most widely used for 4D printing and DLP is the most widely adopted technology owing to the possibility of implementing grayscale lithography. The goal of this review is to emphasize the need for new materials and faster development to enable further applications and wider adoption of this technology in industry and not only research.}
